openstack-ansible-install
=========================

Install OpenStack using Ansible manifest.

This is not intend to be general installer, which works for everybody.
I just intend it to work for Fedora Cloud. Once finished, I will move it to
infra.git/ansible.

This is put here now, to easy collaboration of Fedora Infrastructure team.

Run this playbook as:
  ansible-playbook -i controler, controler.yml
